[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/alfonmga/gzap.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/alfonmga/gzap)

Some parts of the source code were extracted from from [gin-contrib/zap](https://github.com/gin-contrib/zap) and [things-go/gzap](https://github.com/things-go/gzap). I made minor changes to adapt it to the needs of my projects.

## Install

Via go get tool

```bash
